# Frontend Mentor - Room homepage

![Design preview for the Room homepage coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This was a fun project to practice my Tailwind skills, and I found the slider section to be particularly challenging. Achieving pixel-perfect design in this section was the most difficult part for me.

## Build With

- HTML
- TAILWIND CSS
- SWIPER JS

## Usage

Install dependencies (Tailwind)

```bash
npm install
```

Run the Tailwind CLI to compile the input.css during development. The output file is css/main.css

```bash
npm run watch
```

To build once run...

```bash
npm run build
```

You can edit the scripts in package.json and the tailwind.config.js file to change input/output locations
